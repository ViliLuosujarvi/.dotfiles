Nothing too fancy here, just trying to upkeep couple of my computers and at the same time trying to learn new
things regarding servers, programming and in general just about linux and nixos in particular. But please do take a look
of the configs if you happen to enjoy any stylistic implementations. 😎  Also don't mind me having this as my 
artistic canvas that might be messy at times but if ever need be I'll clean it up. My goal is to have clean code that is
easy to use but comments that might end up rambling way too extensively for no apparent reason. XD


( This repo has gotten heavy lift and inspiration from JaKooLit's setup but only in limited amount of the
  full functionality he has made. Also multiple times when I have felt like a puppy left in a rain 
  when I've been trying to get some functionality to work for days or weeks, Gskartwii has given a lot of good
  advice and explanation of what is going on, big mcthankies from mcspankies! )
